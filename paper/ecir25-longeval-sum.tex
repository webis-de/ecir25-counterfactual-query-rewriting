\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

We explored the capabilities of query rewriting approaches for re-occuring queries and counterfactually assume that documents that were previously relevant are still available---even when they might have been deleted or changed---to incorporate them as explicit relevance feedback. Our approaches only need a few documents as feedback, and our results show that this already suffices to significantly outperform expensive transformer-based models. Interesting directions for future work would be also to handle scenarios where the intent of a query might change, take into account how the documents evolve, or how relevance feedback observed for similar queries can be re-used.
