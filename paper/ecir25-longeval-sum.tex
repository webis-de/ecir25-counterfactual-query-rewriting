\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

We explored the capabilities of query rewriting approaches for re-occuring queries that counterfactually assume that documents that were previously relevant are still available---even when they might have been deleted or changed---to incorporate them as explicit relevance feedback. Our approaches only need few documents as feedback and our results show that this already suffices to significantly outperform expensive transformer-based models. Interesting directions for future work would be to also handle scenarios where the intent of a query might change, or on how to re-use relevance feedback observed for similar queries that were seen before.
