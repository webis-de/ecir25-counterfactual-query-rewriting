\section{Related Work}

Things that sound related but are not yet checked/incorporated are appended to this sentence~\cite{li:2022}.

Integrate prior work into the topology by Keller et al.~\cite{keller:2024}. E.g., transfer of relevance labels to (near-)duplicate documents~\cite{froebe:2021a}, documents that change their content and therefore might be not relevant anymore~\cite{froebe:2022d}, etc (Harrie Oosterhuis likely has much on this).
